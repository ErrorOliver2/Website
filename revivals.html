## newer but still a revival of something
[pretendo network](https://pretendo.network) - revives nintendo network on 3ds and wii u
[aerochat](https://aerochat.live/) - basically windows live messenger but you can use it for discord
[hummus](https://hummus.sys42.net) - revival of discord 2016-2017. oldground and rotisserie used to be the same, but they got discontinued. also discord once tried to dmca hummus, so they had to replace all discords names in the hummus client to say "hummus" instead of discord. you can also create your own hummus bot which is cool, somoene even made [a tool called hummus.py to interact with it](https://github.com/LG125YT/Hummus.py) I'm also going to host a OldCord instance as Falcord, it is work in progress.
[neocities](https://neocities.org) - a great place to start off with your first website host

while you're looking at this, wanna look at [my main webpage](https://ErrorOliver.lol)?
