        <p>Do you find this suspicious?</p><br>
        <img src="assets/images/aboutescargot/proof1.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt=""><br>
        <a>Escargot used to be open-source, but they stopped being opensource.. which is kind of suspicious</a><br>
        <a>I don't trust Escargot as I used to anymore, and I recommend moving over to other alternatives like <a href="https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server">retro-aim-server</a>/<a href="https://chivanet.org/">ChivaNet</a>.</a><br>
        <a>I am also working on my alternative, soon to be opensource when I have some developers check over everything. It's called <a href="https://escaropen.erroroliver.lol">Escaropen</a> and it is going to support Skype. <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FBy25XqqnG">Join the Escaropen Discord server</a> and the <a href="https://discord.gg/NYRABAfYV9">Skype Info Discord server</a> for more information.</a>
